This project uses SIPP data from the Census Bureau to look at how residential stability impacts children's well-being. In addition to the research question, the purpose of this project is to practice reproducible and responsible research workflows. All of the information for reproducabilty can be found on my Github.

The data dictionary provides context for the variables that I used from the SIPP data set and how I renamed them for this project. The code for how I read in the variables without the whole data set is in the variables file on GitHub and allows for downloading on the variables needed for this report. This report uses simulated data, and the code for creating the simulated data as well as the data file is on GitHub.
